/** "Network-on-chip" simulator.  This package simulates synchronous grid networks as they are
 * commonly found on chips.  Because this is a class assignment, the simulation makes simplifying
 * assumptions w.r.t. to actual routing in networks-on-chips.

 * <p>The package implements both sequential and parallel simulators.</p>
